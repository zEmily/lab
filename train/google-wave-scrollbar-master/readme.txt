Google Wave introduced a revolutionary new way of online communication and collaboration. It seemed to swiftly solve the problems inherent our current 40-year-old email system. Unfortunately, it never actually caught on.

In addition to rethinking email, though, Google Wave’s user interface also rethought things such as scroll bars. I was particularly impressed with Google Wave’s scrollbars which were small, unintrusive, and easy to use.

In it’s tiny form-factor, the Google Wave scroll bar is able to:

Indicate document height
-Indicate current scroll location
-Scroll by clicking the arrows (dragger doesn’t move until you move your mouse away)
-Scroll by dragging

After being announced that Google Wave will be retired, I wanted to immortalize this new way of scrolling in a jQuery plugin that does the same thing.

Based on konr ness plugin.
